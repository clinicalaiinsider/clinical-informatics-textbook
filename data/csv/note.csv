HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 47-year-old Hispanic female presents for routine follow-up. Reports increased fatigue over past 2-3 weeks, polydipsia, and nocturia 2-3x/night. Has history of Type 2 DM diagnosed 2021, HTN diagnosed 2019, and obesity.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Positive for fatigue, increased thirst, frequent urination. Negative for chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
- Vitals: BP 148/92, HR 98, Temp 98.6F, BMI 32.1
- General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress
- Cardiovascular: Irregular rhythm noted, no murmurs
- Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally

ASSESSMENT:
1. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus - suboptimal control, POC glucose 218
2. Hypertension - elevated today
3. New irregular heart rhythm - recommend urgent cardiac evaluation

PLAN:
- Refer to ED for cardiac workup given new arrhythmia
- Labs ordered: HbA1c, CMP, lipid panel, TSH
- Continue current medications pending cardiac evaluation",32856,4180186,101,1001,PCP-NOTE-001

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 47-year-old female referred from PCP after irregular rhythm noted on exam. Patient reports occasional palpitations over past month, initially attributed to stress. Denies syncope, chest pain, or dyspnea at rest.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:
- ECG: Atrial fibrillation with RVR, rate 124 bpm
- Echocardiogram: EF 55%, mild LA enlargement, no significant valvular disease
- Labs: K 4.1, Mg 1.9, TSH 1.8, HbA1c 8.2%

DIAGNOSIS: New-onset atrial fibrillation, hemodynamically stable

RISK STRATIFICATION:
- CHA2DS2-VASc = 3 (female, HTN, DM) - HIGH stroke risk
- HAS-BLED = 1 - LOW bleeding risk

TREATMENT INITIATED:
- Apixaban 5mg BID for anticoagulation
- Cardiology consultation obtained

DISPOSITION: Discharge to home with cardiology follow-up in 48 hours",32856,4180186,103,1002,ED-NOTE-001

HISTORY: 47-year-old female with newly diagnosed AFib discovered 2 days ago at PCP visit. Initiated on apixaban in ED. Comorbidities include T2DM (HbA1c 8.2%), HTN, obesity.

CARDIAC WORKUP REVIEW:
- ECG: Atrial fibrillation, rate 88 bpm (improved)
- Echo: EF 55%, mild LA dilation (4.2cm), no significant valvular disease
- No evidence of structural heart disease

ASSESSMENT: New-onset atrial fibrillation, likely multifactorial (HTN, obesity, possibly sleep apnea)

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Continue apixaban 5mg BID - appropriate given CHA2DS2-VASc 3
2. Start metoprolol succinate 25mg daily for rate control
3. Target HR <110 at rest
4. Sleep study to evaluate for OSA
5. Lifestyle modifications: weight loss, limit alcohol/caffeine
6. Follow-up in 1 week for rate assessment

Rate vs rhythm control discussion held with patient - will pursue rate control initially given her multiple comorbidities and stable hemodynamics.",32856,4180186,102,1003,CARDIO-NOTE-001
